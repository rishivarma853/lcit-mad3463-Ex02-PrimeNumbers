# Exercise 2-1 : PrimeNumbers.java
Java exercise
Write the program Prime.java which stores in a dynamic table all prime numbers between 2 and 100 and displays the contents of this table.
Test of the primality of a number n (algorithm):
1. Check if the number n is even (if it is, it is not prime unless it is 2).
2. For all odd numbers less than or equal to the square root of n, check if they divide n. If it
is not, then n is prime.
Your program should produce a display similar to this: The prime numbers between 2 and 100 are as follows:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 ...
